# Identifying-Blood-Cells-CNN

For thousands of years our eyes were the best at identifying objects from seeing dangerous animals to bacteria under a microscope, but with the advancements in object detection techniques the machine is far better at it than any human.

## To prove this I got data of 4 types of blood cells in the training and test data: 

1. Neutrophil
2. Eosinophil
3. Monocyte
4. Lymphocyte

These can further be classified into Mononuclear (Lymphocyte + Monocyte) vs Polynuclear (Neutrophil + Eosinophil).
